    <p>
      Galapix is an image viewer that allows you to directly zoom into
      large collection of tens of thousand of images from tiny
      thumbnails down to the images original size fluently with very
      short load times and no loss of interactivity. It accomplishes
      this by keeping a tile cache which stores not only thumbnails
      for one size, but thumbnails of many different sizes. This
      thumbnail cache requires at maximum 1.5x times as much storage
      as the images themselves, but as tiles are generated on demand
      often far less.
