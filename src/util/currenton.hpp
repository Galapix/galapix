/** A class derived from 'Currenton' is allowed to have only one
    instance of itself at a time and a reference to that instance is
    provided via the current() function. The difference to a Singleton
    is that the object creation and destruction isn't done by the
    Currenton, the Currenton only keeps a reference. So normal RAII
    practices can be used for the object construction. */
